            Dave was bornon December 13, 1954, in St. Louis Missouri where he lived with his mother anf father until he was 4 years old.  His pediatrician said he had severe asthma and the dry desert air would soothe his little lungs. So his parents decided to make the move and ended up landing in Tuscon Arizona. 
            
            Dave attended Catholic school through the 8th grade where he attended St. Peter and Paul. Soon after graduating the 8<sup>th</sup> grade his father had found a new job in Phonenix. So he packed up and moved the family. Dave attended West Phoenix High School where he played varsity baseball and jv football and basketball. He was on the chess team and the debate team.

            	Tragically in his junior year his father passed and Dave had to go to work to help support his mother and pay household bills. Although most of his after school activities were limited he still pursured baseball. This was a great outlet for Dave and it was how he dealt with the death of his father.
